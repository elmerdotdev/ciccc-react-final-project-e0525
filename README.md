# React JS - Final Project

**Objective:** Create a full-stack application using the technologies you've learned throughout the program.

## Instructions 📋

1. Decide as a team of what you wish to build. You only have one week so try to limit your features of your MVP.
2. Choose your technology stack (e.g. React, Node, NextJS, etc.) based on what you think fits best.
3. Utilize GitHub Projects for your tasks.
4. Create and name your branches accordingly depending on the type of task you are working on.
5. Make use of automation tools such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky), or even [Biome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@biomejs/biome)!
6. Commit and push your final changes to the `main` branch by the end of the project week.

## Features ✅

Unlike previous projects, for this project you have the freedom to choose what you want to build. However, you need to use the technologies listed below in some form in your web application.

### Frontend 👩🏻‍🎨

Choose at least one:

- React
- NextJS
- Any React-based framework/library such as Remix, React Native, etc.

### Backend 👨🏻‍🔧

- NodeJS or NextJS
- WebSockets such as [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)

### Database 🧑🏻‍🏫

Choose at least one:

- MongoDB with Mongoose
- PostgreSQL with Prisma
- Other database systems are allowed if you wish to take time to learn them (e.g. Supabase, Firebase, etc.)

### Authentication 👮🏻

- User signup and login
- Password strength checker such as [zxcvbn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zxcvbn)
- Cookies (optionally you can store JWT for extra security)

### Deployment 🤖

Depending on your stack, deploy your project through any of these free platforms:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Render](https://render.com/)

You can also choose to self-deploy in a custom server such as AWS or Google Cloud.

## Additional Information ℹ️

- Your MVP needs to be responsive.
- Design an ERD first before creating your database. This will help you layout how your data are connected and stored.
- Make sure to store any API keys and other credentials inside your `.env` files. Never commit them into your respoitory!
- Protect your CRUD API routes. For example, a user who is not logged in should not be able to send `PUT` and `DELETE` requests. The same goes with your pages, a user who is not logged in should not be able to access a page like `/my-account`.
- Communicate with your teammates.

_Good luck with your project and looking forward to your work 🎉🎉🎉_
